# This is a BitCoin Info App

## Introduction
I am currently learning angular2 this is just a little something i started with. It loads info from two API's and updates the info in order to give the user a real time indication of the prices of Bitcoin and Etherium.

### API's 
https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=2<br>
http://api.fixer.io/latest

### Remember to do a npm install in order the get all the modules
